# ML Engineer assignment

Business says they need an app that calculates scientific things. The use case was discussed by the data team and an in-house Data Scientist has drafted a scientific web app for this purpose. The draft app is included. The Data Scientist says the app can be run locally by creating a virtual environment running python 3.9. and then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then, the app should be reachable from localhost:8501.
